## What is it?

- An app that allows to enter in all important dates by category and automatically blast out texts on loved one's special days. Never miss a special day for a friend or family member ever again!

- MVP: As a user I want to login and see a list of automated messages that I have previously set up so I can click on a message and edit or delete it. As a user I want to be able to create an automated message to a friend. A message should include a send date and time and a long text field that enables the message curator the ability to send a custom message.

- Stretch: Allow for a social media sharing aspect that allows you to advertise the app on your social media platform of choice.

## Motivation?

- Enable users to keep track of important dates
- Provide users a reliable way to send friends/family messages on an important date
- Never forget an important date or disappoint a friend/family
